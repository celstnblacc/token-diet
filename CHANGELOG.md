## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

* `scripts/tkd` — global CLI dashboard: `tkd gain`, `tkd dashboard`, `tkd version`, `tkd verify`
* `scripts/tkd-dashboard` — stdlib-only Python browser dashboard (auto-refreshing, dark theme, RTK bar chart, host detection); installed to `~/.local/bin/tkd-dashboard`
* `scripts/install.sh` — `--dry-run` flag: previews all install steps without making changes
* `scripts/Install.ps1` — `-DryRun` switch: previews all install steps without making changes
* `README.md` — Dashboard & CLI section documenting `tkd` commands and browser dashboard

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

* `CLAUDE.md` — project guidance for Claude Code sessions (structure, commands, conventions)
* `README.md` — project overview for the token-diet installer stack
* `README.md` — internal forge mirroring guide: staying in sync with `--mirror`, Forgejo/GitLab pull mirror tip
* `compliance/SBOM.json` — CycloneDX 1.5 bill of materials for all three components (rtk 0.34.3, tilth 0.5.7, serena-agent 0.1.4) with audit results and submodule commit pins
* `compliance/security-audit.md` — completed automated security audit pass (cargo audit, pip-audit, grep checks, Docker config)

### Fixed

* `install.sh` — OpenCode Serena integration now writes to `~/.opencode.json` instead of printing info-only
* `Install.ps1` — OpenCode Serena integration now writes to `%USERPROFILE%\.opencode.json` instead of manual-config warning
* Both scripts pass `--context=ide` to Serena for OpenCode (correct context for non-LSP agent hosts)

### Changed

* Submodule forks (rtk, tilth, serena) point to security-patched versions with `## This Fork` documentation
* `.gitmodules` — removed `branch =` tracking lines; submodules pinned to exact commits for reproducible builds
* `.gitignore` — added `.serena/`, `.vscode/`, `dist/`, `excalidraw.log`
